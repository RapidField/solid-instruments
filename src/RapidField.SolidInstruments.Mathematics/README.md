### Descriptive statistics

[DescriptiveStatistics](Statistics/DescriptiveStatistics.cs) represents a quantitative summary of the size and distribution of a data collection.

### Special sequences

[ArithmeticSequence](Sequences/ArithmeticSequence.cs), [FibonacciSequence](Sequences/FibonacciSequence.cs), [GeometricSequence](Sequences/GeometricSequence.cs), and [PrimeNumberSequence](Sequences/PrimeNumberSequence.cs) are infinite sequence implementations.

### Unit of measurement conversion

[Area](Physics/Area.cs), [Length](Physics/Length.cs), [Mass](Physics/Mass.cs), [Temperature](Physics/Temperature.cs) and [Volume](Physics/Volume.cs) are value types that represent physical measurements.

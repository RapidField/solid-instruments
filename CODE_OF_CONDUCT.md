# Code of Conduct

**Solid Instruments** is a tool set for professional software developers. We expect contributors to act with extreme professionalism. Contributors should respect the time and work of others and should welcome new contributors with kindness, patience and professional courtesy.

New contributors should read the [**Instructions for Contributing**](CONTRIBUTING.md) before beginning work.

## Conflict resolution

When contributors disagree on design or direction, the conflict should be resolved by direct, honest communication. While ideal solutions address the concerns of all involved parties, it is expected that reasonable compromises will sometimes be made. When contributors cannot reach an agreement they should ask for advice from [more senior members](AUTHORS.md) of the team.

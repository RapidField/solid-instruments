# Code of Conduct

Solid Instruments is a tool set for professional software
developers. We expect Solid Instruments contributors to act with
extreme professionalism. Contributors should respect the time and
work of others and should welcome new contributors with kindness
and professional courtesy.

## Conflict resolution

When contributors disagree on design or direction, the conflict
should be resolved by direct, honest communication. Ideal
resolutions to such conflicts should address the concerns of all
involved parties. Otherwise, reasonable comprimises should be made.

When contributors cannot reach an agreement, they should ask for
advice from more senior members of the team.

## Contributing

Before beginning work please read [the guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). For questions, contact [solidinstruments@rapidfield.com](mailto:solidinstruments@rapidfield.com).

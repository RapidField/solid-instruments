# Code of conduct

Solid Instruments is a tool set for serious professional software
developers. We expect Solid Instruments contributors to act
professionally. Contributors should respect the time and work of
others and should welcome new contributors with kindness and
professional courtesy.

## Conflict resolution

When multiple contributors disagree on design or direction, the
conflict should be resolved by direct, honest communication. Ideal
resolutions to such conflicts will address all of the concerns of
those involved. Otherwise, reasonable comprimises should be made.

When contributors cannot reach an agreement, they should ask for
advice from more senior members of the team.
